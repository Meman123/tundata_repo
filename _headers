# Caching Rules for Tundata Next.js Project
#
# Default behavior: Do NOT set a blanket "no-cache" rule for /*.
# Next.js handles caching for its pages (HTML) and data routes effectively.
# Overriding this broadly can break Next.js's own caching mechanisms (like ISR, SSG image optimization).

# Cache Next.js static assets (JS, CSS, etc.) aggressively.
# These files are fingerprinted, so they can be cached immutably.
/_next/static/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

# Cache static assets from the 'public' directory aggressively.
# These are served from the root path.

# Specific files in the root of 'public'

# Favicon can be cached for a shorter period if it might change more often,
# but a long cache is also fine if it's stable.

/Candidatos/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
# Add /fonts/* or /images/* if those directories exist in 'public' and contain static assets.
# Example:
# /fonts/*
#   Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

# The following rule is from the original file.
# It applies to any assets served from a top-level '/static/' directory.
# If such a directory exists and contains assets not managed by Next.js's
# `public` or `_next/static` systems, this rule is fine. Otherwise, it may be redundant.
/static/*
